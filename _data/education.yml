    <mark>Master's thesis</mark> - <b>Revisiting Ensembles for Knowledge Graph Embeddings</b>
    <br>In this work, we study the ensembles in KGEs with better trained baselines. Additionally, fine-tune and joint learning were further experimented on ensembles. The study shows that, although ensembles generally outperformed single KGE models with better trained baselines, fine-tuning has shown minor progress comparing to established ensembles. Also, the approaches by joint learning lead to outputs inferior to established ensembles with the same training specification.

    <mark>Master's thesis</mark> - <b>Forecasting of time series based on vector autoregression model and maximum cross-correlation</b>
    <br>In this work, we provide a new multivariate-time series prediction method based on the concept of maximum cross-correlation, enhancing the prediction performance using vector autoregression model(VAR). Using the mean prediction squared errors (MPSE) as assessment criterion, the prediction method based on the maximum cross-correlation best performs under all prediction periods.
